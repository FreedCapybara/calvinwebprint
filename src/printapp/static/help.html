      <h4>Setup</h4>
      <p><em>Note</em>: You only need to setup your account once.</p>
      <h5>Connect your account</h5>
      <p>
        In order to print, you must connect your account to Google Cloud Print. Connect to Google Cloud Print by simply clicking the “Connect your account” button.
        Make sure you are logged in to your StudentMail account when you are allowing Calvin Web Print permission to manage your printers.
      </p>
      <h5>Add Calvin Printer</h5>
      <p>
        If you have never used uniFLOW to print, you will need to add Calvin's uniFLOW printer to your Google Cloud Print account. 
        To do this, click “Add Calvin Printer” and a new window will pop up. Click “Accept” then close the window. 
        Now you are all set to print using Calvin Web Print.

      <h4>Print</h4>
      <p>
        First select a file that you would like to print. The file must be a Word document, PDF, OpenOffice document (.odt), or picture file format.
        You may click “Cancel upload” at any point to cancel the upload.  Specify the number of copies you would like, as well as any of the different options. 
        Once the file is uploaded, click “Submit.” Now your file is ready to be printed at a printer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are wondering why you cannot print your document double-sided and stapled, we disallow it is because the pages of double-sided documents get stapled out of order.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are printing more than one copy and want to know what the “Collate” option means, refer to the 
        <a href="http://www.formaxprinting.com/blog/tag/what-is-collated-printing/" target="_blank">diagrams on this page</a>.
